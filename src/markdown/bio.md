##About Me##

Iâ€™m a software developer from Southwest England where I live with my wife & two children.

I am proficient in **Javascript** (**Node.js** + Client-side), UI frameworks (**React**, **Svelte**), **Python**, **Java**, **Rust**.

I have 20 years experience in Retail Management running an independent trade store. Within that role I handled day to day liason with retail and trade customers so am used to communicating with clients of varying levels of technical knowledge.

I also assist with the _Digital Devon scheme_, providing an IT support service to members of the East Devon community.

In my spare time I am a keen Triathlete and Sailor. I also do coding puzzles & games. (Advent of Code, Codewars, etc)
